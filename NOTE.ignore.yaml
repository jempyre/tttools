Notes:

- """Using fully formed custom `type`s to pass your datas betwixt your `function`s you
**may use the declaration of the `struct` as the properly formed `docstring`**"""
- """Do we integrate `yaml` as a data store on the base doc?`-` the giveaway"""
- functions are the class of julia
  + they create methods and data-access as needed
  + """implementing inheritance is as easy as leveraging variable-scope ie
    ```julia
    function class(meta::Meta, data::Data{T::Any}...)
        _{
        "meta" => meta
        "data" => data
        }
        class()
    """
